This project is a full-stack e-commerce website for a ficitious clothing retailer called Artisan Alllrue Fashions.
The front-end was created using React and the back-end using Node and Express.
Additionaly data for this application is stored in MongoDB.

Although I am done working on this project there is a lot more I would've liked to add and improve.
Therefore, if there is anything in the application that does not work as intended like a missing feature
it is becuase I haven't gotten around to that.

--- IMPORTANT PLEASE READ ---     
Some additional details, the website is being hoasted using Render.com. I have used the free version
of Render.com so please keep in mind that there may be some slow downs when trying out the application.
According to Render.com requests from the back-end are delayed up to 50 seconds or more when initially loading the application unless I pay for the premuim versions.
