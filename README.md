This project is a full-stack e-commerce website for a ficitious clothing retailer called Artisan Alllrue Fashions.
The front-end was created using React and the back-end using Node and Express.
Additionaly data for this application is stored in MongoDB.

Although I am done working on this project there is a lot more I would've liked to add and improve.
Therefore, if there is anything in the application that does not work as intended like a missing feature
it is becuase I haven't gotten around to that.

Some additional details, the website is being hoasted using Render.com. I have used the free versions
of Render.com as well as MongoDB Atlas so please keep in mind that there may be some slow downs when trying out the app.
